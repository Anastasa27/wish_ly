####Wish.ly is an app for creating a wish list that can be shared with friends and family. Perfect for any gift-giving holiday or occasion, Wish.ly will keep track of your heart's desires. Written almost entirely in JavaScript and Ajax, Wish.ly is a lightweight client-side app with an API back-end which features a robust relational database.

**please note that I haven't added any authorization, login or user information as I am using this app primarily as a demo.**
